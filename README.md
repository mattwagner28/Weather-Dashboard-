# Weather-Dashboard-
Bootcamp Assignment #6 -- A weather dashboard that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide a 5-day forecast for any location. It also saves your locations to local storage.

# Notes as of 3/7/23
This app only displays the basic functionality. It successfully pulls the 5-day forecast from the weather API, providing the date, an icon displaying the weather status (rain, sun, clouds, etc),
humidity, and wind speed. 

I didn't have time to save the cities to storage or create a page reload function everytime the user searches. I will add these later if I have time. 

I know there is an issue where if you search for another city, it leaves the data from the previous city. Again, will fix later if I have time.
